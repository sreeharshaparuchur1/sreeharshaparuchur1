### About

MS Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, working with [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) on **3D scene representations for Vision-Language-Action models** in robotic manipulation.

I care about two things: making robots understand the 3D world, and making them act intelligently within it. That usually means working somewhere in the intersection of:

- **Reinforcement Learning** — policy learning, GRPO, reward shaping for long-horizon tasks  
- **3D Perception** — Gaussian Splatting, multiview geometry and LiDAR/camera fusion
- **Foundation Models for Robotics** — VLA fine-tuning, using World Models for trajectory forecasting

### What I'm Working On
```
Robot sees world in 3D
         ↓
Builds rich scene representation (3DGS / NeRF / DUST3R)
         ↓
VLA reasons over scene + language instruction
         ↓
RL policy executes & improves from interaction
```

Current focus: improving spatial reasoning in VLAs for dexterous manipulation using learned 3D scene priors.

### Writing / Notes

Occasional notes on things I'm reading or building - RL theory, 3D vision, and robotics systems.
